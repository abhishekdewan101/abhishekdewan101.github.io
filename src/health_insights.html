									<h3>Summary</h3>

										<p>
											<b>Aim</b>
											<br>Samsung health is samsung's primary health offering for its flagship devices and other android phones, providing users with the ability to track and store their health related data by using the various sensors that are present on phones nowadays.In order to keep up with changing environments, the team was tasked to provide samsung health with an edge over its competitors meanwhile increasing the engagement of the users with the app.

										</p>

										<p>
											<b>Solution</b>
											<br>Health insights were created with the aim of intelligently providing its users with personalized snippets of their health related data, using a dynamically generated card based interface.<br>
										</p>

									<h3>The Journey</h3>
										<p>
											<b>Research</b>
											<br>The team performed multiple rounds of users research, desk study and competitive landscape evaluations to arrive at some of the pain points listed below. It is these pain points that led to the next step in the process to create health insights.<br>
											<div class="6u$ 12u(medium)" style="padding-top:0.5em;padding-left:1em">
												<ul>
													<li>Users loved the idea of a contextually relevant information delievery mechanism that portrayed a level of intelligence.</li>
													<li>Samsung health scattered the data of the user and the process of hunting the data was off-putting to the users. </li>
													<li>Although samsung health had a lot of use features for the users, finding and using them wasn't simple.</li>
													<li>Samsung health did not provide it's users with the required motivation to stay on top of their health goals</li>
												</ul>
											</div>
										</p>

										<p>
											<b>Iterative design</b>
											<br>Multiple brainstorming sessions were performed by the team to reach the final version of health insgihts. Initially, health insights was designed to provide its users with a chatbot like interface that allowed the users to interactively engage with their health data.<br>

											</div>
											<div class="image-caption">Initial brainstorming concepts</div>
											After user testing and careful consideration, the team decided to create a card based layout for health insights. The card based layout approach was adapted as it provided the team with a modular approach towards thinking about health insights. Modularity of the cards allowed the team to conduct user research to understand what kind of messages were important to the users.<br>

											</div>
											<div class="image-caption">Re-arranging card modules during user research</div>
											Analyzing the users reactions to the modular layout, the team made a final decision on the final layout of the insight feed. From here, the team diverted it's attention to the text that would be shown to the user. Since health insights was a text based product, getting the tonality and personality of the insights was curcial to the sucess of the product.<br>

								<div class="detail-page-section3 12u">
									<h3>Prototype</h3>
									<p>
										Several prototypes were created during the design process in order to validate the concept that the team had put together. These prototypes included invision prototypes that allowed simple visual design validation, to high fidelity android working prototypes that allowed us as a team to validate the overall product as a whole. The android prototype was optimized for Samsung Note 5. You can download the apk from <a href="../assets/files/insight.apk">here</a>.
