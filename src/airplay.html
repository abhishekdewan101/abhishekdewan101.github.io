									<h3>Summary</h3>

										<p>
											<b>Aim</b>
											<br>Increasingly the devices that people choose for their home's do not come from the same manafacturer. However, with this trend arises a problem that we all face everyday. The ability to connect these devices to work together becomes a hassle and no company has been able to provide a viable solution to this problem.

										</p>

										<p>
											<b>Solution</b>
											<br>Project airplay was created as an experiment to see if Samsung could provide it's users with bridging the gap by allowing them to share their content to Apple TV's and other products from different manafacturers.<br>
										</p>

										<p>
										<b>Role</b>
											<br>Android Developer | Desing Technologist<br>
										</p>

										<b>Project Dates</b>
											<br>November 2015 - December 2017<br>

									<h3>The Journey</h3>
										<p>
											<b>Research</b>
											<br>Since this project was just an experiment, the research phase was very brief focussing on researching exisisting products that perform the same things that we were trying to do. During the course of my research I came across a open source project that allowed android phones to share video content with apple tv's. The library was called "Connect SDK" and this library was used to create the prototype.<br>
										</p>

										<p>
											<b>Iterative design</b>
											<br>In order to provide the user with a seamless experience, a guiding principle while designing was to ensure that it takes the user the least amount of steps to perform the sharing. The process of pairing devices should have a simplified user interface that is intuitive and is invokable anywhere in the system.<br>
											We went through several iterations of how the interaction should look like. With every iteration, I would do a quick prototype and we would conduct a gorilla user study session to get feedback from our colleagues.<br>

												<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/projecta/exp6.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
											<div class="image-caption">Working through the different variations</div>
											The final solution as can be seen was able to cut down the number of steps down to 4 and also provided the user with the ability to cast audio content to a speaker that is not connected to the TV.<br>

									<h3>Prototype</h3>
									<p>
										In order to create a quick functional prototype, the sharing service was written in android using the connectSDK. For the user interface, I employed a technique called motion prototyping, whereby I mixed a motion study of the entire application with android code such that the user could touch spefic touch targets and be able to invoke the next part of the video. This type of prototyping allowed us to show the users the entire user experience without downgrading the fidelity.
