									<h3>Summary</h3>

										<p>
											<b>Aim</b>
											<br>The market for telemedicine services are growing at a very rapid pace. To keep up with the changing landscape, Samsung Health wanted to present it's users with the ability to access telemedicine services directly from its consumer health product.

										</p>

										<p>
											<b>Solution</b>
											<br>Ask a doctor was proposed as a possible solution that integrated the telemedicne services directly into Samsung health using exsisting patterns and norms. The product was eventually shipped under another name "Ask an Expert" along with the launch of Samsung Galaxy S8.<br>
										</p>

										<p>
										<b>Role</b>
											<br>Product Designer | Design Technologist <br>
										</p>

										<b>Project Dates</b>
											<br>January 2016 - June 2016<br>
										</p>

									<h3>The Journey</h3>
										<p>
											<b>Research</b>
											<br>In order to understand the problems that users face when it comes to the telemedicine industry, the team performed various forms of research like desk research, competetitve evaluation and also talking to users. The following points emerged as the major pain points for the telemedicine industry as whole:<br>
											<div class="6u$ 12u(medium)" style="padding-top:0.5em;padding-left:1em">
												<ul>
													<li>Users love the convinence of having the medical advise of a doctor just a phone call away.</li>
													<li>Working with user's exsisting insurance plan is a big factor for adaption.</li>
													<li>Users do not trust the medical advise from telemedicine services when it comes to chronic diseases.</li>
												</ul>
											</div>
										</p>

										<p>
											<b>Iterative design</b>
											<br>Following the research phase, the design team performed multiple brainstorming sessions in order to come up with an inital design for the service. The initial design for the service acted like a forum where the users could post a free question to the network of doctors and they could get a response back soon.<br>
											<div class="row uniform" style="padding-top:0.5em">
												<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/healthinsights/research1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
												<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/healthinsights/research3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
											</div>
											<div class="image-caption">Initial brainstorming concepts</div>
											With user testing and research it was found out that the users really appreciated the free question interaction model and it became a center piece for the design moving forward. The other changes made to the design was in the inclusion of a face to face video consultation service that would allow users who were willing to pay a preimum to access this service.<br>
											The design was fleshed out into wireframes that were then again put through user testing and validation. The testing proved the model of interactiont that the team had thought about and then we moved to refine and polish the design.<br>

											</div>
											<div class="image-caption">Inital wireframe concept for ask a doctor</div>
											Following iterative design principles,as can be seen below, the team went through serveral iterations of the homescreen and other screens in order to adapt the design to the changing needs of the users and also to accomodate for the resaerch findings. The addition of a onboarding screen as seen in the second image was thought to be a good idea, however, it was removed subsequently in favour for a more minimalistic approach of introducing the feature.<br>

									<h3>Prototype</h3>
									<p>
										During the design process I had created a lot of prototypes of varying fidelities. The concept was tested with users using these prototypes and then the final prototype (seen below) was done completely in android. The android prototype was optimized for the Samsung Note 5.

									<h3>Final Product</h3>

										Ask a doctor was finally released under a different name "Ask an Expert" in the global market along with Samsung health v5.6. The feature was re-released in the US market recently with the launch of the samsung galaxy s8										<div class="row uniform" style="padding-top:0.5em">
